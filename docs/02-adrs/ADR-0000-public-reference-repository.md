ADR-0000 — Public Reference Repository Location

Status: Accepted

Context:
The project aims to serve as a public reference for sovereign architecture patterns while avoiding exposure of sensitive data.

Decision:
The reference repository is hosted publicly on GitHub, containing only documentation, architectural artifacts, and sanitized templates.

Consequences:
	•	Increased visibility and accessibility
	•	Clear separation between reference and runtime layers
	•	Mitigated sovereignty risk by excluding secrets and operational data
